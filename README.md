# Comparisons of Poems from the Pearl Manuscript

<sub>Final Project, Application of Articut, Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence: Basic Concepts and Implementation, Spring 2025, NYCU</sub>

In this project, we do comparisons between and visualize the *word type* and *part-of-speech* classifications for the four poems.

## Technologies Used

* **ArticutAPI:** For word type extraction and POS tagging.
* **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
* **Plotly Express:** For interactive visualizations.
* **NLTK:** For sentence segmentation.
